# Baitube

This package uses [Baileys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@whiskeysockets/baileys) and [ytdl-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core)
Thanks to them I was able to develop this package, so give them a star in their repositories.

This also depends on [yt-katze](https://github.com/Garruxx/yt-katze), which tests a graphql api for queries, requires it to be running on port 2222.

Baitube is a terminal package that allows you to create a bot with your whatsapp number to download songs and videos from youtube and whatsapp. This package is just an experiment and if you are going to use it please follow the youtube terms and conditions. Use it at your own risk.
